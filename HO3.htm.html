                  <td>Orientation is an important program held at the beginning of a school year or when new students enter a school, college, or university. It serves as a welcoming activity that introduces students to their new environment, the people they will interact with, and the rules and routines they need to follow. More than just a simple event, orientation plays a vital role in helping students adjust, feel comfortable, and prepare for academic success.</d>
                  
                  <td>Brigada Eskwela is an annual program of the Department of Education in the Philippines that brings together teachers, parents, students, and community members to prepare public schools for the opening of classes. Usually held before the start of the school year, this nationwide activity reflects the true spirit of “bayanihan”, or community cooperation, where everyone works together to clean, repair, and beautify the school environment.</td>
                  
                  <td>The Youth Formation Division (YFD) is a special unit within the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines that focuses on the development of learners beyond academics. Its main goal is to help shape the values, attitudes, and leadership qualities of Filipino youth through co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. The division plays a key role in building well-rounded students who are not only intelligent but also responsible, respectful, and socially aware.</td></tr></table></center>

To ensure these groups run effectively, organization or club elections are held each year to choose student leaders. These elections are more than just a school tradition—they are a valuable learning experience that helps students understand leadership, democracy, and responsibility.</td>
                  
                  <td>In the evolving landscape of education, particularly with the growth of online and hybrid learning, the concept of a soft opening class has become increasingly valuable. A soft opening class, also known as a trial or pilot class, is a preliminary version of a full course offered to a limited group of participants before the official launch. This strategic step allows educators and institutions to refine course content, test delivery methods, and gather essential feedback, ultimately leading to a more polished and effective learning experience. </td>
                  
                  <td>The flag ceremony is a traditional and meaningful activity conducted in many schools and public institutions, especially in countries where national pride and patriotism are deeply valued. It involves the raising or saluting of the national flag, accompanied by the national anthem, and often includes a short program with prayers, pledges, or inspirational messages. Although it may seem simple, the flag ceremony holds deep significance in shaping discipline, unity, and love for one’s country. </td>
